## Acknowledgments

This toDoList is an effect of our group effort as an optional project related to JavaScript course by Coders Lab , that all of us attended and completed. 
Project has been started and done during the course causing the code style to be a little chaotic. There is no React Framework implementation as well, although our solo projects are done mostly in React.

Take your time and try our To Do List App. Program uses Local Storage so you will keep your tasks on the list unless you clear cookies.
